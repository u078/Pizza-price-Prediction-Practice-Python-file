# Pizza-price-Prediction-Practice-Python-file

## Context

### The dataset given is for predicting the prices of pizza, the dataset is not complete at all, but you can use this dataset for learning or study or maybe you want to upgrade the data by yourself, is okay for me, hopefully, this dataset is useful for you guys, and use this dataset wisely.

### In this project we will be building a model which will predict the prices of data based on different parameters such as number of toppings, diameter, etc.

#### We will use different Machine Learning Models and then we will see how we can do all of this with the help of Auto Machine Learning. We will be using Eval ML Library for this project

### Time Line of the Project:
- Importing Libraries and DataSet
- Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Model building using ML models
